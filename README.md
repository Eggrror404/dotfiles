readme under construction :)

dotfiles are managed by GNU Stow. apply with the following

stow .
```

## notes

- GTK

  the gtk css files are generated by [Gradience](https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience) with the [Rose Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) palette.
  they are supposed to worked with Adwaita, so you'd need [`adw-gtk3`](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3) (`adw-gtk-theme` on Arch) for it to work.
  and the symlinks stow create doesn't seem to get along with flatpak'd gtk apps, so you may have to manaully copy the files over.

  also, to remove the close button in gtk:

  ```sh
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout "appmenu:"
  ```

- Zen

  Zen by default has a floating title bar when hovered, which would become empty after removing the close button. turn it off in `about:config` with option `zen.view.experimental-no-window-controls`.
