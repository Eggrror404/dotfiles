## notes

- GTK

  the gtk css files are generated by [Gradience](https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience) with the [Rose Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) palette.
  they are supposed to worked with Adwaita, so you'd need [`adw-gtk3`](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3) (`adw-gtk-theme` on Arch) for gtk3 the theme to work.

  also, you may want to remove the close button in gtk with this command:

  ```sh
  gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout "appmenu:"
  ```
